## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not detecting URLs**

- Ensure file is saved and has a supported extension (.html, .css, .js, .json, .yaml, .md)
- Check that the file contains valid URLs (HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, mailto, tel, file)
- Try reloading VS Code window (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` → "Developer: Reload Window")

**Performance issues with large files**

- Files over 10MB may take longer to process
- Safety warnings will alert you when processing large files
- Consider splitting very large files into smaller chunks for better performance

**URLs not appearing in results**

- Verify the URL format is supported (HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, mailto, tel, file, relative)
- Check that URLs are properly formatted and not inside comments
- Ensure the file type is supported and URLs are in expected locations
- Check for proper URL formatting and protocols

**Extension crashes or freezes**

- Check VS Code version compatibility (requires 1.70.0+)
- Disable other URL-related extensions temporarily
- Check Output panel → "URLs-LE" for error messages

### Getting Help

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/nolindnaidoo/urls-le/issues) page for known problems
