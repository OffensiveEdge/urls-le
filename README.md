## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not detecting URLs**

- Ensure file is saved and has a supported extension (.html, .css, .js, .json, .yaml, .md)
- Check that `urls-le.enabled` is set to `true` in settings
- Try reloading VS Code window (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")

**Performance issues with large files**

- Files over 10MB may take longer to process
- Consider using `urls-le.includeComments: false` to reduce processing time
- Enable `urls-le.sortByFrequency: false` for faster extraction

**URLs not appearing in results**

- Verify the URL format is supported (HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, mailto, tel, file, relative)
- Check if `urls-le.extractHttp`, `urls-le.extractFtp`, etc. are enabled
- Ensure URLs are not inside comments if `urls-le.includeComments` is disabled
- Check for proper URL formatting and protocols

**URL validation issues**

- Enable `urls-le.validateUrls: true` for URL validation
- Check that URLs are properly formatted and accessible
- Some URLs may be valid but not reachable from your network
- Relative URLs may not be valid without proper context

**Accessibility checking problems**

- Enable `urls-le.checkAccessibility: true` for accessibility analysis
- Check that URLs are accessible and follow accessibility guidelines
- Some URLs may require authentication or special permissions
- External URLs may not be accessible for accessibility checking

**Domain grouping issues**

- Enable `urls-le.groupByDomain: true` for domain-based grouping
- Check that URLs have valid domains for grouping
- Some URLs may not have extractable domains
- Relative URLs may not be groupable by domain

**Extension crashes or freezes**

- Check VS Code version compatibility (requires 1.85.0+)
- Disable other URL-related extensions temporarily
- Check Output panel ‚Üí "URLs-LE" for error messages

### Getting Help

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/nolindnaidoo/urls-le/issues) page for known problems
- Enable telemetry logging: `urls-le.telemetryEnabled: true`
